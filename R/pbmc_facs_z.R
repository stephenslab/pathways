#' @description Results from differential expression analysis of
#' single-cell RNA-seq profiles generated from bead-enriched
#' subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs). The
#' data were downloaded from
#' \url{https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets}.
#'
#' @format \code{pbmc_facs_z} is a matrix of z-scores, with rows
#' corresponding to (human) genes and columns corresponding to
#' differential expression analyses; differential expression was
#' measured separately for each cell type (B cells, T cells, natural
#' killer cells, CD14+ cells and CD34+ cells).
